## Stapes taken to upload on Gitlab

First of all I clone my main branch of projects into my local computer with comand git clone and paste the https link from Github. After that from main branch I created a new branch and name it as Project_01 with comand git checkout -b plus the name of the new branch.
As soon as i created my new branch I add my project and i added to the staging area with comand add . added them in the .git repo with comand git commit -m "Added project".
As soon as i finished all my changes i push them in Github with command git push.

## Working with Terminal

While i was uploading my project i used a terminal in vs code to add my files and make a changes.

Create an accound in Github;

- Config username and email in your terminal, with comand git config –global user.email “” ; git config –global user.name “ ”;
